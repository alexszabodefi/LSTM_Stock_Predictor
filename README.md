# LSTM_Stock_Predictor

In this project tensor flow was used to create an LSTM price preditor for bitcoin. Two models were created one using BTC historical price and the other using the Crypto fear and greed index. These models were then compared and the findings were that the model based on closing price history was much more accurate.
